In January 2025, I began consulting with Aline, a clinical and perinatal psychologist, to help her create posts for her **Gestando uma Mãe** program.

The goal was to produce impactful content that addressed the common challenges and questions during pregnancy, thereby increasing her digital presence and audience engagement.

### Initial Diagnosis and Alignment
In the first stage, we had a brief conversation to identify the central theme of the work.

Aline shared details about her work with mothers and families and explained the importance of the **Gestando uma Mãe** program.

This initial contact was essential to align expectations and lay the groundwork for a more in-depth meeting.

### Creation and Strategy Definition
A few days after our meeting, Aline shared a post in which she listed common questions and thoughts, such as:

- "I'm pregnant, now what?"
- "Will I be a good mother?"
- "I'm feeling so ugly..."

This material served as inspiration for creating a series of specific posts, each addressing an aspect of the anxieties and challenges faced by expectant mothers.

The content developed proved to be valuable and supportive, providing immediate added value for prospective clients interested in Aline’s work.

In less than three weeks, we were able to establish a comfortable and effective routine for producing and publishing the content.

### Achieved Results
The new routine not only increased the frequency of posts but also helped us identify new opportunities to improve the content.

Aline began to feel more motivated to share on social media, maintaining a posting frequency that suited her current situation.

This case exemplifies how a personalized strategy, combined with creative writing and the smart use of digital tools, can transform the online presence and results of professionals who wish to connect authentically with their audience.
