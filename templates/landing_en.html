      <p>Many people struggle to post consistently because they feel it will be too much work to maintain, and in the end, it might not even bring any return.</p>
      <blockquote>
        ⚠️ It’s not an exaggeration: it’s easy to get lost in the process and end up exhausted, frustrated, or even demotivated. Without an active digital presence, many professionals miss out on opportunities every day.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Instead of relying on inspiration or the pressure to post something at all costs, you need to establish a <strong>workflow that fits into your daily routine</strong>, allowing your content to emerge naturally and spontaneously.</p>
      
      <p>All of this is supported by <strong>Creative Writing</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>Creative Writing transforms your interests into authentic, repurposable content, building trust and generating new opportunities.</p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence, in turn, ensures quality and value in every post without demanding excessive effort.</p>

      <p>With a consistent routine, you'll be well-prepared to build an engaged community, creating an organic source of new clients.</p>

      <h3 class="title is-3">How It Works</h3>
      <p>This mentorship works in three stages:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>1. Discovery</strong><br>
        We analyze your experience and interests to define the three pillars of your content.
      </p>
          
      <p>
        <strong>2. Creative Writing</strong><br>
        We develop a pilot piece of content based on these pillars, using techniques that make your writing fluid and sustainable – always with the support of Artificial Intelligence.
      </p>
          
      <p>
        <strong>3. Review & Routine</strong><br>
        We review the entire process and structure a practical routine for creating and posting content, exploring strategies to repurpose your content intelligently.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Result</strong><br>
        At the end of the mentorship, you'll have a content creation routine aligned with your vision, interests, and experience. And best of all, you'll be able to do it independently, with my support for adjustments or to celebrate your progress.

        <strong>Success Story</strong><br>
        In January 2025, I collaborated with Aline, a clinical and perinatal psychologist, to boost her "Gestando uma Mãe" program on Instagram. After an initial conversation to understand the challenges and anxieties of expectant mothers, we defined a personalized post format. In less than three weeks, we implemented an effective routine that significantly increased the frequency and engagement of Aline’s posts.

      <h3 class="title is-3">A Bit About Me...</h3>
      <p>Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Otávio Nathanael, and I currently live in Corumbá, Mato Grosso do Sul.</p>
      <p>Since I was 14, I've always dreamed of having my own business. This motivated me to learn English on my own and dive into creative writing – back then, I was addicted to fantasy books (haha).</p>
      <p>In 2018, at 17, I enrolled in a Systems Analysis and Development program at IFMS, Corumbá campus.</p>
      <p>It was three intense years, filled with studies and many frustrated attempts in the freelance world.</p>
      <blockquote>"If I can't find work in my city, maybe I'll get it elsewhere..."</blockquote>
      <p>In 2020, a month before the pandemic, I landed my first freelance job on UpWork after several interviews in my city that never materialized. (Living in the interior is tough – I wasn’t even called for general services, haha.)</p>
      <p>Interestingly, my first clients were from outside Brazil. My first contract was with a startup from New York.</p>
      <p>I started as a Python tutor and, over time, began coordinating and developing new products for them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two months later, I secured my first full-time position as a Junior PHP Developer at a company in London, focused on onboarding new businesses and providing essential services.</li>
        <li>I balanced this new role with a few hours at the startup.</li>
        <li>After a year, I realized it no longer made sense and decided to focus solely on the full-time position.</li>
        <li>Shortly after, I moved to another company, where I had the opportunity to try different roles (Solution Architect, Data Analyst, Team Manager, Marketing & Sales) and collaborate on both national and international projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since then, I have participated in various projects and challenges, accumulating experience along the way.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>But something still felt missing.</strong></blockquote>
      <p>In 2024, I spent almost the entire year in therapy, reflecting on my journey, my personal challenges, and what I truly wanted for the future.</p>
      <p>I also began to look back on my past and realized that, back then, I aspired to be a fiction writer. Writing has always been a passion, but I had to set it aside to focus on a more viable path for my future.</p>
      <p>Today, I find myself balancing the dreams of the past with my current reality, and I've discovered a middle ground that can serve me both professionally and personally.</p>
      <p>I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready for the challenge.</p>
